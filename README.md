# Console wrapper

**WIP!**

This program is intended to wrap a console program, and display its
stdout and stderr streams in a text box. Ultimate goal is to add a few
buttons with additional functionality. and perhaps color the output
appropriately.

At the moment the program mainly demonstrates that the streams are
buffered, resulting in stdout and stderr output being in the wrong
order.

The program is created in Visual Studio 2022. To run unaltered, Python
(with the `py` launcher) should be installed.
